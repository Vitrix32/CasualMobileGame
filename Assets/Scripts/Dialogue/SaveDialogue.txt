How're you doing?`Player: Oh, well you know, just trying to find something to do today. Have you heard anything today?`Jeff: You bet there's stuff to do in this busy town! Always something going on yessiree! Let me see if I can remember, Well I heard the at the south west part of the town has some sort of pest problem, if you're looking for a bit of action, but if you want a slower warm up to your day I hear old miss Marlena has some errands that she could probably use a hand with.`Player: Ok thanks. It ain't much but I suppose it should keep me busy for a little bit.`Player: Hey wait, if you know all these things that need done, why don't you do them?`Jeff: Well look, I've got my hands full with uh, legal stuff, like I always do! Plus I think I'm gonna be heading to New Castle upon the Thyme soon, there wasn't a lot of legal business to attend to here so I think my thyme might be better used elsewhere.

I seem to have, misplaced some papers. If you see any scrolls lying around I get the feeling they might be mine, could you grab them for me?`Player: Yeah sure, but what if I don't see you again before you leave?`Jeff: I'm sure you'll see my again, there's not a lot of barristers out an about these days so somehow has to be willing to pick up their shoes and get to those in need.`Player: You say that but you seem to do a lot of sitting while you're here.`Jeff: What was that?`Player: Hm?
