You see, I'm a bit more than your average cat as you might have noticed, but that doesn't just include the ability to talk. I've lived a very long time, I remember Cataclysm, I saw him.`Samantha: You mean 'it'?`Magic Cat: No. Cataclysm was a crazy but powerful warrior. The wizard that gave me my magicalness lured him out to an empty plain and imprisoned him in stone. He tasked me with watching to make sure he stayed imprisoned but a town popped up around 'a cool looking statue', that town being Graville.`Jack: Wait, are you saying that big statue in town is a PERSON?`Magic Cat: I wish that was the end of it, but I've noticed cracks in the stone, he's breaking free and I've got to be ready for when he comes. I thought I could draw some magical energy from this mystic lake and its magical water, but I can't remember how.`Player: Hey, don't worry, you've got something better than magic: us!
